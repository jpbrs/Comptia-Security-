## Threats, Malwares and Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Shimming** is when the attacker places some malware between an application and some other file and intercepts the communication to that file (usually to a library or system API). In many cases, this is done with a driver for a hardware component.
2. **Refactoring** é o ato de refatorar o código(e o comportamento) do malware para ele não ser reconhecido em nenhum software anti-malware baseado em signature
3. “Cyberintelligence **fusion** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and then distributing information between disparate agencies and organizations. **Fusion centers** like those operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focus on strengthening shared intelligence activities.”
4. No sentido estrito da palavra, **malwares podem ser considerados PUPs**
5. “**White teams** act as judges and observers during cybersecurity exercises.”
6. “SOAR is a relatively new category as defined by Gartner. Security orchestration, automation, and response includes threat and vulnerability management, security incident response, and security operations automation, **but not automated malware analysis**.”
7. “**rootkits are more likely** to be detected by AV programs”
