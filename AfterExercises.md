## Threats, Malwares and Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Shimming** is when the attacker places some malware between an application and some other file and intercepts the communication to that file (usually to a library or system API). In many cases, this is done with a driver for a hardware component.
2. **Refactoring** é o ato de refatorar o código(e o comportamento) do malware para ele não ser reconhecido em nenhum software anti-malware baseado em signature
3. “Cyberintelligence **fusion** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and then distributing information between disparate agencies and organizations. **Fusion centers** like those operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focus on strengthening shared intelligence activities.”
4. No sentido estrito da palavra, **malwares podem ser considerados PUPs**
5. “**White teams** act as judges and observers during cybersecurity exercises.”
6. “SOAR is a relatively new category as defined by Gartner. Security orchestration, automation, and response includes threat and vulnerability management, security incident response, and security operations automation, **but not automated malware analysis**.”
7. “**rootkits are more likely** to be detected by AV programs”
8. Principios da engenharia social:
      1. Familiarity
      2. Trust
      3. Scarcity
      4. Authority
      5. Urgency
      6. Intimidation
      7. Consensus, sometimes called social proof, is a social engineering principle that leverages the fact that people are often willing to trust groups of other people.
9. Polymorphic Virus é um Virus que muda sua forma a cada execução
10. Time-of-Check/Time-of-use é uma espécie de race condition
11. “Elicitation, or the process of eliciting information through conversation to gather useful information, is a key tool in a penetration tester’s social engineering arsenal.”
12. “A macro virus is a malicious script (macro) embedded into a file, typically a Microsoft Office file. They are typically written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script”
13. “ Pharming attempts to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate site to another malicious site. Attackers most often do this by changing the local hosts file or by exploiting a trusted DNS server.”
14. Apesar de acharmos que um IP estrangeiro seja uma obrigatoriedade de uma APT “would attack from a foreign IP address, they often use a compromised address in the target country as a base for attacks”
15. Prepending : “Thus, you need to know that when it is used for this exam it can mean one of three things: adding an expression or phrase to an email, subject line, or headers to either protect or fool users. They also note that it can be used when adding data as part of an attack, and that social engineers may “prepend” information by inserting it into conversation to get targets to think about things the attacker wants them to.”
16. “Although auditing some libraries or libraries that are custom-developed for the code is common, auditing all libraries used in the code is unlikely except in exceptional situations.”
17. “A denial-of-service (DoS) attack may target a memory leak. If an attacker can induce the web application to generate the memory leak, then eventually the web application will consume all memory on the web server and the web server will crash.”
18. **Skimming** is stealing our credit card information as we use the card for some other purpose.
19. **Man in the Browser** Malware is used to change the client's computer network routing to perform a classic man-in-the-middle attack.
20. Botnets geralmente se conectam com o Command and Control via IRC, um protocolo antigo usado para Internet Relay Chat. Padrao do IRC de fato sempre foi executar o IRC em TCP 6667.
21. Calling their extension é ligar para o RAMAL. Vishing é Phishing de Voice, não de Video!
